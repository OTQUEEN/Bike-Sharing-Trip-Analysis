#  Summary of Analysis
Having carefully organized, cleaned and analyzed the dataset, we are glad the share the following findings that were revealed as the summary of the analysis. 
1. From figure 1, it was revealed that the number of members were slightly greater than that of casual in the cited period. 
This indicates that there are more potential casuals that can be converted to members to boost their revenue.
2. Figure 2 also shows that within the period, Q3 tops as the highest among the periods with the highest number of casual trips follow by Q2 as the second highest of casual trips. 
3. Again, figures also indicates the weekday with the highest number of trips. 
It's clearly shows from Sunday - Saturday, the highest number of trips usually happens on Saturday,
followed by Sunday of which are also attributed to casual trips. And the least number of trips is on Sunday relating to members trip.
4. In figure 4 and 5, it shows the hour in which most of the member/casual trips start and end. 
From the hour 00:00 - 23:59 hour, 17:00 is the time most trips starts followed by 18:00 and 16:00. 
Also, 17:00 tops as the time most trips end, followed by 18:00 and 16:00 hour. 
5. Finally, figure 6 shows the number of trips and their respective duration. It's clearly shows that casual trips last significantly longer as compare to member trips. 


#  Recommendations
Based on the above analysis summary, I recommende the marketing team to develope a strategic marketing plan and 
promotions that will aim to convert the casual riders to become member riders (subscribers) by considering the follow:
1. Intensifying the marketing and promotions in the period of Q3 and Q2.
2. Also, considering having ramdom promotion that will convert the Saturdays and Sundays riders to subscribe to become members.
3. Develope a plan that will convert the long duration riders to become members
